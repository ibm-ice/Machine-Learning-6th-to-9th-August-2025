    "## 1. What is Predictive Modeling ? \n",
    "Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling, data mining techniques and machine learning. Companies employ predictive analytics to find patterns in this data to identify risks and opportunities. To gain insights from this data, data scientists use deep learning and machine learning algorithms to find patterns and make predictions about future events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How we define Machine Learning ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine  learning  is  the  process of  programming  computers  to  optimize  a  performance  criterion  using example data or past experience. We define a model up to some parameters and learning is the execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience. The model developed may be __predictive__ to make predictions in the future, or __descriptive__ to gain knowledge from data, or both.\n",
